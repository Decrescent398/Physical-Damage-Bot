## How to Build It

### Step 1: Wiring the Motors
1. Take a Y-connector and connect the two ESCs.
2. Connect the ESCs to the motors.
3. Ensure that the motors spin in opposite directions.

### Step 2: Constructing the Base
1. Cut a flat piece of cardboard.
2. Attach a 360-degree servo to the bottom.
3. Cut a long rectangular piece of cardboard.
4. Attach a 180-degree servo to the rectangular piece.
5. Stick the rectangular piece onto the flat cardboard base.

### Step 3: Assembling the Shooting Mechanism
1. Mount the two motors so that their wheels are spaced the diameter of a ping pong ball apart.
2. Attach the shooting mechanism to the end of the rectangular piece.

### Step 4: Wiring the Components
1. Connect the Y-connector to the throttle channel of the receiver.
2. Connect the 360-degree servo to the yaw axis.
3. Connect the 180-degree servo to the pitch axis.

### Step 5: Creating the Ammo Magazine
1. Take the Pringles can and stick it behind the motors.
2. Cut a hole in the can to allow the ping pong balls to exit.
3. Make a small hole at the back and install a servo to push the ping pong balls out one by one.
4. Attach this servo to a switch on the transmitter.
5. Add a flap on the Pringles can to control the release of the balls one by one.
